Class 1 - Jan 18, 2024
Learning Unity & Bitsy

Read chapters 16-19 and tested Hello World project. The cube exercise worked perfectly. I also learned how to use Bitsy and made a quick game for class.

Class 2 - Jan 25, 2024
Playtesting Bitsy Game + Unity in class

The game worked well, a good start to understand the basics of layout and world mapping. Set up gitignore in class and tested new Unity project.
