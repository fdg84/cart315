# Francis Ouellette - Design Journal (CART 315)

## Class 1 - Jan 18, 2024 
Intro class, Powerpoint slides, talking about games and seeing which programs we will be using over the course of the semester. Watched game examples and tested Hello World project. The cube exercise worked. Also learned how to use Bitsy and made a quick game for class.

## Class 2 - Jan 25, 2024 
Made a tiny game with Bitsy. Playtested in class with other students. Learned how to play with layout, cell building and conceptual game planning. The game worked well, a good start to understand the basics of layout and world mapping. Set up gitignore in class and tested new Unity project. Read chapters 16-19.

## Class 3 - Feb 1, 2024 
Followed the readings, did some tests in Unity as homework. Watched tutorial videos and tried physics. Sleepy emoji class example was working. Followed this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZvNFrS7wTM&ab_channel=Hooson). Read chapters 20-24.

## Class 4 - Feb 8, 2024 
Made a Pong game, adapted it to Cellbreaker. Had issues following certain tutorials but was able to debug and make the project function correctly. Followed this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyXZ3RVe5as&ab_channel=SilverlyBee). Read chapters 26-28. 

## Class 5 - Feb 15, 2024 
Game Analysis for Killer7. Thinking about which elements I will want to include in my own project and how to implement it. Watched more online tutorials. Read chapter 25.

# Class 6 - Feb 22, 2024 

Started 2D tutorial of Shmup game in class (https://youtu.be/rH9IHdp1dyU?si=EQex-yHawIQw4nwY). Continued at home, found a way to debug the Rigidbody / Collision. Ended up following a second tutorial to make a 3D version (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeBEvM2zMpY&ab_channel=samyam). Learned a lot of new things about setting up a game. Very inspiring for final project, started writing about my concept and figuring out the levels and interactions.

# Class 7 - March 7, 2024 

Conceptualizing / Ideation Process +++ Made paper version of IDEA 01 : trying out the concept and figuring out details concerning actual play-through of the game. So far it seems like it can work, I need to redefine a few core concepts. 

IDEA 01 >>

3d world / glowing floating words
Collect them in various order 
Walk w notebook / Create sentences / Find meaning 
The ghost trying to communicate 
The mother node / internal dialogue
Add portal to switch scenes
3 levels of words / Last one holds the puzzle 
Unlocks connection w mother
Grading system / Score percentage before each portal
15 words total / Collect 5 per level 
Create your most coherent sentence
Judged at the end / Receive various poetic responses 
Depending on final score
Add toxic words / Diminish score / Hidden motives
Different types of design / For each level 
use my Blender 3D models as assets
globe like layout / infinite world / instead of being trapped by walls

IDEA 02 >>

words growing like garden
alien seeds / evolution / nature
biology / alchemy / observations
put seeds together to create new species
growing / climb giant plants 

IDEA 03 >>

computer virus
jumping from different phones
crash their systems
airdrop images / erroneous messages
passing through internet cables to travel
tubes / tunnels
spawn a family of other viruses
take over the world / crash city systems
map of areas you have taken over
world map / travel fast / anywhere you want

# Class 8 - March 14, 2024 

After the first round of play testing in class, I can see the issues I will possibly encounter during the creative process. The most prominent of these concerns revolves around the point system that is associated to the word combinations I have attached to the game. I guess the best way to proceed will be to add more direct criteria for judging how good or bad the player's game is going, in connection to reaching the last stage with the mother. The points will differentiate how well the player has chosen word categories to achieve a high ranking position in the game. I also want to include 'toxic' words that will bring the points down so I must figure out the exact way of doing so. Overall, the play testing enticed the other students and prompted some good responses and general questions on the game. The paper version I made acted as a conceptual way of presenting the possible video game made in Unity. I explored touch and feel, as well as function and actual game play. I am looking forward to exploring the more digital side of the game's production in the coming weeks.

# Class 9 - March 21, 2024 

I played through the game by myself to figure out the proper points system. After counting each card and playing 7 rounds, I could see that my concept was working alright. The player should aim for 555 points (determined by the letters of the alphabet). If your total exceeds this amount you fail the game, and if your total exceeds 600, you most likely have picked the Toxic cards which have higher points  associated to them, which ultimately is a bad thing. I still need to simplify the concept concerning points, but at least the play testing has provided positive outcomes. 

A few days later, I decided to adapt the same concept for my CART 263 final project for Pippin's class. I used the points system and layout to develop a similar game play which I thought could be possible without too many changes. The project will include an AI speech bot and voice recognition, creating a highly interactive version of the game for the player.
